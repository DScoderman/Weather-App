# Weather-App

## Description 

The weather app is designed to pull a five day forecast based on what city the user inputs in the search bar. The ultimate end goal is to help users plan for weather forecasts when traveling to multiple cities in a short period of time. This project primarily uses a combo of HTML, javascript, API's and bootstrap to get the content and data on the page. While the page does look clunky, I was able to get a mixed success in that most of the information needed is on the page. In the future, I plan to add in the previous search history results, the date, and attempt to weave in Jquery.

(*Note: date display and previous search results are still a WIP)

## Usage

Users need to type in a city in the search bar. Once done, click the search button and it will lay out the temperature, humidity, and miles per hour for that day. There is also a five day forecast based on the city name the user wrote in the search tab. From there, it will show the weather over the course of the next five days.
